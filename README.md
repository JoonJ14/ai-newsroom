# AI Newsroom

> Keeping up with AI news is a full-time job. Let your AI do it instead.

**AI Newsroom** is a real-time AI/tech news aggregator that scrapes 22+ sources every 6 hours and makes everything available via MCP. Connect it to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any MCP client — one command, no install, no auth.

Ask Claude *"what's new in AI today?"* and get a real answer, not stale training data.

## Quick Start — one command, zero config

### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ai-newsroom https://jialdowpnekknmxrwrdq.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp
```

### Claude Desktop / Any MCP Client
Add to your MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-newsroom": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://jialdowpnekknmxrwrdq.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Start asking questions.

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Never used MCP before? No problem. Pick your platform and follow the numbered steps.

### Option A: Claude Code (Terminal)

If you use Claude Code in your terminal, this takes one command:

1. Open your terminal
2. Run this command (copy and paste the entire line):
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http ai-newsroom https://jialdowpnekknmxrwrdq.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp
   ```
3. That's it! Start a new Claude Code session by typing `claude`
4. Try asking: "What's new in AI today?"

Claude will now have access to real-time AI news from 22+ sources. You can ask things like:
- "What are the latest Anthropic announcements?"
- "Any interesting AI papers this week?"
- "Search for news about Claude Code"
- "What did I miss since Friday?"
- "Show me everything — don't cap the results"

### Option B: Claude Desktop (Mac/Windows App)

If you use the Claude desktop app:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Click the menu icon in the top-left corner
3. Go to **Settings** > **Developer** > **Edit Config**
4. This opens a JSON file. Add the following (if the file is empty, paste the entire block. If it already has content, add the `"ai-newsroom"` entry inside the existing `"mcpServers"` section):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ai-newsroom": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://jialdowpnekknmxrwrdq.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop
6. Start a new conversation and try: "What's the latest AI news?"

### Option C: Cursor IDE

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd+Shift+P` > "Cursor Settings")
2. Go to the **MCP** section
3. Add a new MCP server with these settings:
   - **Name:** ai-newsroom
   - **Type:** http
   - **URL:** `https://jialdowpnekknmxrwrdq.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp`
4. Save and restart Cursor
5. In the AI chat, ask: "What's trending in AI right now?"

## What can you ask?

Once connected, just talk to Claude naturally. Here are some examples:

| What you want | What to ask |
|---|---|
| Quick daily briefing | "What's new in AI today?" |
| Specific company news | "Any Anthropic announcements this week?" |
| Search for a topic | "Search for news about MCP" |
| Catch up after time off | "What did I miss since Friday?" |
| Deep dive on trending | "Show me what's hot on HackerNews and Reddit" |
| Research papers | "Any interesting AI papers published recently?" |
| Release tracking | "What's the latest Claude Code version?" |
| Full firehose | "Show me all the news, no limits" |
| System health | "How fresh is the AI news data?" |

---

## What problem does this solve?

| Problem | AI Newsroom |
|---------|-------------|
| Claude doesn't know what happened after training cutoff | 22+ sources scraped every 6h, always current |
| Asking Claude to search is slow and shallow | Pre-cached in DB, MCP returns instantly |
| Too many sources to check manually | Aggregated from blogs, Reddit, HN, ArXiv, GitHub, HuggingFace |
| Hard to know what's actually important | Community scores + optional AI relevance filtering |
| Miss weekend announcements on Monday | 90-day retention — nothing gets lost |

## Optional: Personal Digest

Get a daily AI news briefing delivered to your messaging app, filtered by topics you care about.

### Supported platforms
- **Discord** — webhook (easiest setup)
- **Telegram** — bot API
- **Slack** — incoming webhook
- **iMessage** — macOS only

### Setup
1. Copy `config/sources.yaml` and customize the `digest` section
2. Set your delivery adapter and webhook URL in `.env`
3. Optionally set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for AI-powered relevance filtering
4. Test with: `npm run digest -- --dry-run` (prints to stdout without sending)
5. Send for real: `npm run digest`

### Automatic Daily Digest

**Option A: GitHub Actions (recommended — runs even if your machine is off)**

The digest workflow is included at `.github/workflows/digest.yml`. To enable it:

1. Go to your GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` — your Supabase service role key
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — your Discord webhook URL
3. The digest runs automatically every day at noon Eastern (4:00 PM UTC)

You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab > Daily AI News Digest > Run workflow.

**Option B: Local cron (if you prefer running on your own machine)**

```bash
# Default: noon
./scripts/setup-cron.sh

# Custom time: 9:30 AM
./scripts/setup-cron.sh 9 30
```

Note: your machine must be on at the scheduled time for local cron to work.

## Self-Hosting

Don't want to use the hosted endpoint? Run everything locally.

### With Supabase (recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joonj14/ai-newsroom
cd ai-newsroom
npm install

# Set up your Supabase project and add credentials to .env
cp .env.example .env

# Run the database migration
supabase db push

# Collect news manually
npm run collect

# Deploy the MCP Edge Function
supabase functions deploy mcp
```

### With SQLite (fully local, no external services)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joonj14/ai-newsroom
cd ai-newsroom
npm install

# Enable local mode
echo "NEWSROOM_STORAGE=sqlite" >> .env
echo "NEWSROOM_DB_PATH=./data/newsroom.db" >> .env

# Collect news
npm run collect

# Run MCP server locally
npm run dev:mcp
```

### Customizing Sources
Edit `config/sources.yaml` to enable/disable individual sources or entire groups:

```yaml
# Disable all Reddit sources at once
# In the sources list, set enabled: false for each reddit source

# Or use source groups to quickly filter
# Only want Anthropic + community? Enable those groups, disable the rest
```
